			<div class="main_indent">As between you and Pivotal, you exclusively own all rights in and to the Contributions that you submit to the Pivotal Site. Pivotal needs a limited license from you so that we can use your Contributions to make the Pivotal Expert Services and Pivotal Site available to you. For example, if you upload product specifications, product drawings or an animated graphic presentation of how a product works to the Pivotal Site, we need a license from you to display, perform and distribute these Contributions in order to make these Contributions available to you on your project pages. And, if you permit third parties (such as your customers or consultants) to view your project pages, we need to have a license to sub-license your Contributions to these third parties so that they can view and use your group pages.<br />
			By making a Contribution to the Pivotal Site, you grant to Pivotal a limited, perpetual, non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your Contribution to anyone else in addition to Pivotal), fully-paid, royalty-free (meaning that Pivotal is not required to pay you to use your Contribution), sub-licensable (subject to the restrictions below), transferable (solely because we need the right to transfer this license to a successor Pivotal Site operator) and worldwide (because the Internet and the Pivotal Site are global in reach) license to use, modify, perform, display, reproduce and distribute the Contribution for the sole purpose of operating the Pivotal Site and Pivotal Expert Services. Pivotal needs the right to “modify” and “reproduce” your Content, because the software and servers hosting the Pivotal Site modify and reproduce your Content automatically in order to make the Pivotal Site and Pivotal Expert Service available.<br />
			We will only sublicense your Contribution for the following purposes: (a) to make your Contributions available to any third party (such as a client or a contractor) that you permit to view your project pages on the Pivotal Site; and (b) to permit a third party hosted services provider to host the Pivotal Site.</div></section><br />
